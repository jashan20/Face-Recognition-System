Creating datasets (datasets.py)
Train the model (training.py)
Recognize faces (recog.py)
Instructions - How to Run ?
First run datasets.py to generate datasets. Make sure that it creates two folders(datasets and trainer). The 'datasets' folder contains the grayscale images.

Supply proper ID for the face before running training.py.

Run recog.py and don't forget to set each person's face to unique ID.

If you have more face to be include, change the ID and run the code again.
